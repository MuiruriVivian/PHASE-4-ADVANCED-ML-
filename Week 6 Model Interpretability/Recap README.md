Recap
In this module, we introduced the topic of interpretability in machine learning, which involves understanding how machine learning models make predictions and decisions. We outlined the importance of interpretability in ensuring model transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness. We described how machine learning is used to aid human decision-making in various disciplines such as medicine, fraud detection, and customer churn. Then, we discussed some of the ethical and social implications of interpretability, such as the potential for bias and discrimination, and the need for diverse perspectives and input in the development and deployment of machine learning models.

You also learned that we can categorize machine learning models by their perceived interpretability using the terms "white box" to describe models with transparent and intuitive methods of interpretation, and "black box" to describe models that are less intuitive but can still have explainable results. We identified numerous white-box models, like logistic and linear regression and decision trees, and described some of the advantages of using them. Then, we discussed some potential use cases for white-box models.

Then you had an opportunity to wield your skills and create a decision engine that automates the decision of purchasing a property. You implemented a logistic regression model using Python and scikit-learn to classify homes as McMansions, then practiced interpreting the results using several methods for understanding the relationships between input features and model predictions, including visualization techniques such as confusion matrices to represent precision and recall, and coefficients to determine the relevance of particular features.

We reviewed how to interpret the coefficients of linear models, the importance of features in decision trees, and the odds ratios and confidence intervals in logistic regression models. In addition, you learned about the limitations of white-box models and the importance of considering the broader context and ethical implications of using machine learning to automate decisions.

Next, we explained black-box models in the context of machine learning and the trade-off between the added complexity versus the increase in accuracy. We outline the importance of understanding how black-box models make predictions and describe several methods for explaining these models, including model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. In the subsequent codealong lesson, we implemented a neural network using Python and the MLP Classifier in scikit-learn. We demonstrated how to fit and evaluate these models and described some strategies for improving their interpretability, such as using feature selection and visualization techniques.

As a data professional, your job is to build models that can make predictions or classifications based on data. However, it's not enough to just build a model that performs well on your training data - you also need to be able to understand and explain how your model is making its predictions. This is where interpretability/explainability comes in. Overall, interpretability/explainability is a crucial aspect of the data science workflow. By building models that are transparent and interpretable, you can ensure that your predictions are accurate, trustworthy, and compliant with regulatory requirements.
